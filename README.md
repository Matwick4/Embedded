<h2> What this project is about?</h2>
<code> //TODO</code>
<br>

<h2> Hardware Platform </h2>
This project has been developed for the MSP432P401R board and the BoosterPack MKII by Texas Instruments.<br>
Besides this, hardware-dependent code is isolated in its own folder so that porting to other platforms does not require rewrting the application logic.
<br>

<h2> Tools used </h2>
Code Composer Studio has been used for developing, uploading the software to the platform and debugging. .
To communicate with the peripherals we have also used libraries provided by Texas Instruments in the MSP432 SDK.
